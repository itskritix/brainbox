/**
 * Put a mark on the host page itself (NOT the shadow DOM).
 *
 * The shadow host is `rr-block`ed so the widget's own chrome stays out of
 * recordings; putting the mark in the host document instead means rrweb sees
 * it as ordinary mutations and it replays in the dashboard with no
 * replay-side support at all.
 *
 * Marks are anchored to the **document**, not the viewport, and they stay
 * until the user clears them. An earlier version expired them after three
 * seconds, which was the wrong answer to a real problem: a viewport-anchored
 * mark starts pointing at whatever slid underneath it the moment the page
 * scrolls. Converting to document coordinates fixes that properly - the mark
 * rides the content it was drawn on - so there's nothing left for a timer to
 * protect against, and the user gets to keep an annotation on screen for as
 * long as they're still talking about it.
