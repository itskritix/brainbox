/**
 * The paywall. Runs after verifyAuth(), so a valid session is a given and the
 * only question is whether the Account has paid.
 *
 * Returns 402 Payment Required rather than 403: the dashboard distinguishes
 * "you cannot do this" from "you have not subscribed yet" and only the latter
 * should redirect to the plan picker.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT applied to:
 *   - /api/billing/*  an unsubscribed Account must be able to reach checkout
 *   - /api/me         the dashboard needs an identity to render the shell
 *   - /ingest         a lapsed Account's users should never have feedback
 *                     silently dropped; we keep accepting and lock the
 *                     dashboard instead.
